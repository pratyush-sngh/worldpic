First hand on experince with flask. 

Idea is to Build a mini social networking site around panoramio. A user can register and login through facebook and find photos anywhere in the world .

will be using following technologies
Flask (Python)
Mysql
Bootstrap
Jquery
Google maps and places for search
Panoramio API
Facebook Graph API (just for login)
REST Architecture 

May or may not add testing depending on how the code looks.
